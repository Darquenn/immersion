\section{The Line}
\label{sec.line}

You will develope the code in 


A polynomial of degree 1 is a function $p(x)=a x + b$ whose graph is a line.   If $a=0$ the
line is horizontal an crosses the y-axis at $y=b$; thus if $b\neq 0$ then $p(x)\neq 0$.
So if $a=0$ we will assume that $p(x)$ has no root.
