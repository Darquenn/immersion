\section{The Line}
\label{sec.line}

You will develop the code in \code{src/line.py}.

\begin{listing}{}{code.line}
\begin{minipage}[c]{0.95\textwidth}\begin{lstlisting}
def find_x_intercept(a,b):
    if a == 0:
        ...
    else:
        ...
\end{lstlisting}\end{minipage}\end{listing}

\input{pfg-line}



A polynomial of degree 1 is a function $P(x)=a x + b$ whose graph is a line.   If $a=0$ the
line is horizontal an crosses the y-axis at $y=b$; thus if $b\neq 0$ then $P(x)\neq 0$.
So if $a=0$ we will assume that $P(x)$ has no root.   

Otherwise we have a line as shown in Figure~\ref{fig.line}.


You should update the code in the file \code{src/line.py} so that if
$a$ is 0, then the function returns an empty list and otherwise
returns a list of the value~$\frac{-a}{b}$.  You must figure out how
to write that in the Python language.  \Ie, you must figure out how to
divde two numbers in Python and how to create a list, empty and
otherwise.
