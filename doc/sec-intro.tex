\section{Introduction}
\label{sec.intro}

In this atelier you will experiment with software development
in the cloud using GitHub and the Python programming language.

You will finish the development of a program which will compute the
roots of polynomials of degree 1 through 5.
\begin{align*}
  a x + b\\
  a x^2 + b x + c\\
  a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d\\
  a x^4 + b x^3 + c x^2 + d x + e\\
  a x^5 + b x^4 + c x^3 + d x^2 + e x + f
\end{align*}

The suite of Python functions you will implement (finish the implementation of)
are designed to review your mastry of
\begin{itemize}
\item Polynomials
\item Factorization
\item Quadratic formula
\item Finding Extrema using the Derivative
\item and more
\end{itemize}

In Section~\ref{sec.github} you will setup your cloud environment. You will
then examine and modify a simply \code{hello world} program.

In the remaining sections, starting with Section~\ref{sec.line}, you
will develop Python code to compute the roots of polynomials.  In
Section~\ref{sec.line} you'll find the sole root of a 1st degree
polynomial (called a line).  In Section~\ref{sec.quadratic}, you'll
find at most two roots of a 2nd degree polynomial (called a
quadratic). In Section~\ref{sec.cubic}, you'll find at most three
roots of a 3rd degree polynomial (called a cubic).  If there's time
remaining in the atelier, Sections~\ref{sec.quartic}
and~\ref{sec.quintic} deal with 4th and 5th order polynomials.  Even
if there's not enough time to finish all the exercises in this
atelier, you may continue the work on your own time, because your
account of GitHub will remain in place as long as you do not
delete it.

Good Luck! And Happy Coding.
